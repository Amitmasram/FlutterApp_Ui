  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section
  assets:

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see

  # Each entry in this list should have a "family" key with the font family name
  # and a "fonts" key with a list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font.
  # For example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
